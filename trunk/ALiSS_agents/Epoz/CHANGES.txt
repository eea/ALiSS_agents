Epoz - Changes

 0.9.0
 
     - Reorganized directory layout into core, i18n, images & plone. Please
       note: You need to "reinstall" Epoz with Quickinstaller / External Method
       when using Epoz in CMF/Plone.
     
	 - Andy Dustman provided a patch for removing MS-Word-Garbage-tags.
	   Thanks Andy!!!
	   
     - Documentation about Epoz for end-users is provided by Tom Purl (see 
       "EpozBook":http://zopewiki.org/EpozBook). Thanks Tom!
 
     - fixed bug: Plone-Toolbox didn't check permissions 'View' and 
       'List folder contents' in breadcrumbs. Thanks to Cyrille Lebeaupin
       from Ingeniweb for patch!
       
     - fixed bug: Image-Preview in Plone-Toolbox was broken in IE.
     
     - fixed bug: JavaScript in content-area could break Epoz...       
       Thanks to Christian Zagrodnick from gocept.com for patch!
       
     - cleaned up line-endings. No more need to write complicated 
       PERL/C++/ADA-Scripts to get rid of them...
     
     
 0.8.6

     - fixed bug: Mozilla / Firefox leaves a single br-tag for
       an empty form. Epoz will clean this mess now.

     - added a wysiwyg_support-switch so Epoz can coexist with 
       other wysiwyg-editors in Plone (esp. Kupu). Moved former
       wysiwyg_support to epoz_wysiwyg_support. Thanks to
       Duncan Booth for patch!!!

     - little cleanup to epoz_script_widget: refactored img-string
       for spacer, so the code becomes more readable.
                
     - fixed bug in epoz_toolbox: CMFPhotos were only shown for preview,
       but not for inserting as image. Thanks to Bjorn van der Meer
       for patch!!!
       
     - updated russian translation; thanks to Michael Krishtopa!
	 
     - added some new FAQs.

 	 
 0.8.5
      
     - added keyboard shortcuts for Mozilla / Firefox which are already
       supported by IE: CTRL + b for bold, CTRL + i for italics, CTRL + u
       for underlined, CTRL + k for create link.

     - added a HowTo for easier setup of mxTidy to get valid XHTML from Epoz
       (see mxTidyHowTo.txt).
     
     - fixed bug: made width/height-settings for Epoz working
       with Archetypes. Thanks to Christian Theune from Gocept for patch!
       
	 - fixed bug: corrected the slashing of folders in Epoz-toolbox 
	   for Plone (http://plone.org/collector/3479)
	          
       
 0.8.4

     - fixed bug: toolbox didn't start from the correct location if the
       portal_factory was activated.

     - fixed bug: wysiwyg support in Plone could be broken, because
       URL3 in wysiwyg_support isn't available under all circumstances.
       I forgot that the damn test()-method evaluates all expressions
       always, regardless of the condition... Thanks to Simon Pamies
       for patch!
       
     - updated browser-detection-javascript to Browser Detect v2.1.6.
              
     - some whitespace-cleanups thanks to AnyEdit for Eclipse.      

 0.8.3

     - added a FAQ. Pleae read it before asking questions...

     - added label for html-source-switch, because many people asked for
       it. Hope this helps clearing up the meaning of the little checkbox
       below the wysiwyg-area...

     - added translations for tidy-messages in the browser-status-bar to
       en & de. Please note: Don't use any entities if you want to translate,
       because the browser-status-bar doesn't support entities!

     - Fixed bug: missing form_path in epoz_script_widget caused problems
       when using portal_factory in Plone. Thanks to Danny Bloemendaal (for
       detecting the problem) and Geoff Davis for patch! Added a check to
       wysiwyg_support to detect document-creation via portal_factory.

     - Fixed bug: the Epoz-Iframe in epoz_script_widget wasn't loaded via
       an absolute url, so browsers could complain when running Epoz via https.

 0.8.2

     - Updated license to Zope Public License 2.1.

     - Danny Bloemendaal provided a cleaned up toolbox for use in Plone 2.
       Thank you, Danny!

     - Added "Photo" (CMFPhoto) as selectable image-type to the toolbox.
       Thanks to Shane Graber for patch!

     - set wordwrap for mxTidy/uTidy to 79 character to avoid some problems
       with splitted a-href-tags.

     - fixed bug: making relative urls for images was broken in EpozPostTidy
       for people who have no mxTidy / uTidylib installed.

     - fixed bug: removed .strip() from data-handler in Extensions/EpozPostTidy.py,
       so required whitespace isn't killed; added a "useless-whitespace"-cleanup
       to EpozPostTidy.

 0.8.1

     - Now the setup for getting relative urls from Epoz is much more easier:
       There's a default EpozPostTidy.py in Epoz/Extensions which can be
       used out of the box.
       Simply create an External-Method in the root of the ZMI or your Plone-Site with
       id=EpozPostTidy, Module-Name=Epoz.EpozPostTidy, Function-Name=EpozPostTidy.

     - added a customcss-parameter (esp. for use in Plone) to render customized
       css-styles in difference to a global css correctly.

     - fixed bug: the XMLRPC for tidying etc. is now independent of your
       Zope-Server-Root, so the EpozPostTidy-Hook can be created in
       your Plone-Instance without a VHM-Setup anymore.

     - fixed bug: canceling "Add anchor" resulted in emtpy tag. Thanks to
       Simon Pamies for patch!!!

     - fixed bug: IE complained about security when Epoz was called via
       https. Thanks to Sam Brauer and Andrew Athan for patches!

     - fixed bug: <embed>-tag was replaced by <ibed> in Mozilla. Thanks
       to Christian Ledermann.

     - fixed bug in epoz_script_main.js.dtml/InitEpoz: IE 5.0 isn't
       wysiwyg-able and therefore needs to fall back to a textarea. Thanks
       to Marc Zacher!

     - updated epoz_lang_pt-br. Thanks to Luiz Fernando Pasqual S. Souza!

     - updated epoz_lang_zh-cn. Thanks to panjunyong!

     - updated epoz_lang_no.js.dtml. Thanks to Einar Jensen!


 0.8.0

     - added support for uTidylib (http://utidylib.sourceforge.net/);
       Thanks to Shane Hathaway from Zope Corporation for his
       patches!!! Please note: there are still some problems with UTF8;
       maybe someone can provide a patch?

     - rearranged the Javascript so that it's not necessary to
       "auto"-switch to source mode when saving. Thanks
       again to Shane Hathaway from Zope Corporation for his patches!!!

     - added pageurl-parameter to Epoz; pageurl defines the base
       url of the edited page. The pageurl is forwarded to Epoz(Post)Tidy,
       so you can rewrite urls according to the given base url.
       **PLEASE NOTE:** You must add an additional parameter
       if you use EpozPostTidy-Hooks in your applications.

     - added support for adding anchors; works very nice with Mozilla, IE
       doesn't show the css-styles. IE is crap anyway...
       Thanks to Christian Theune from Gocept for his patches!!!

     - added global support (EpozGetRelativeUrl) for calculating relative urls
       from absolute urls; Thanks to Gilles Lenfant for this feature! Please
       see README.txt for how to enable this feature.

     - added simple example for EpozPostTidy-Hook to README.txt.

     - added danish-translation; thanks to Nikolay Kim!!!

     - fixed bug: IE couldn't handle anchors; added base-tag to
       epoz_blank_iframe.html. Thanks to Stefanie Panke pointing
       me to this problem.

     - changed default height of the edit form in Plone to be a more
       sensible 450px (limi).

     - removed annoying pop-up saying "Your browser does not support
       XML-RPC" from the JS. If it doesn't, we degrade anyway - no reason
       to insult the user. ;) (limi)

     - fixed epoz_toolbox to use 'sanctioned' calls for meta_types. Thanks
       to Marc Lindahl for patch!!!

     - wysiwyg_support was causing a wierd error when used
       inside CMFBoard sometimes (Attribute Error: meta_type). Traced it to
       test of text_format. test() evaluates both true and false branches.
       Restructured it to fix the problem.  Thanks to Marc Lindahl for patch!!!

     - fixed tabindex for Plone (limi)

     - added class="visualFontSizeCorrection" to body-tag of
       epoz_blank_iframe.html; mostly needed for displaying correct font-sizes
       for the wysiywg-area in Plone 2.0. Please note: To use this with
       older Plones, add visualFontSizeCorrection { font-size: 75%; }
       to your ploneCustom.css (limi)

     - synced default wysiwyg_support with Plone 2.0.
