Localizer 1.1.3 (2006/12/13)
============================

Localizer is a Zope product for developers and web masters. Localizer
solves the problem of building multilingual products and web sites,
ranging from internationalization and localization of the user interface
to management of multilingual content.

The 1.1.3 release brings some new features for ZPT. Most important is
the support of interpolation. And now message catalogs are searched for
within the "Localizer" objects, if it exists.

There are also a couple of bugs fixed:

 - The method "LocalPropertyManager.__getattr__" works again.

 - The function "Utils.lang_negotiator" works now when the context
   is not available.

Credits:

 - Mikel Larreategi fixed "LocalPropertyManager.__getattr__".
 - Josef Meile worked on ZPT.
 - Yoshinori Okuji fixed "Utils.lang_negotiator".

Localizer 1.1
=============

April 11, 2005 - Two years after release of Localizer 1.0, I am
pleased to announce the availability of the next major version,
Localizer 1.1.

Localizer is a Zope [1] product for developers and web masters.
Localizer solves the problem of building multilingual products
and web sites, ranging from internationalization and localization
of the user interface to management of multilingual content.

What's new in 1.1
-----------------

This release brings several new features. Specifically Localizer
now supports industry standards such as TMX [3] and XLIFF [4],
which enhance the interoperability of Localizer based applications
within mainstream environments. 

Native support for 'i18n' namespaces for ZPT (Zope Page Templates)
is included avoiding the need to install other products.

The user interfaces have been vastly improved, specially for
'LocalContent' objects.

Four new translations are available: Danish, Italian, Portuguese
and Russian.

Localizer 1.1 has been re-packaged and now depends on itools Python
package and iHotfix Zope product. While these changes make installation
a bit more complex, the added benefit is simplified source management.
Furthermore this subtle change makes Localizer Services available to
the wider audience of Python [5] developers.

Last but not least, Localizer's stability has been dramatically
improved by resolution of many bugs resulting in a mature and even
more reliable product.

Localizer 1.0.1
===============

Localizer is a Zope product that provides a set of facilities
to develop multilingual web applications. It offers solutions to
internationalize the user interfaces and to manage multilingual
content.

The changes of this release are:

 - Added missing docstring to the Localizer class, thanks to
   Christian Scholz.

 - Strip the quality when parsing an accept header, this lets the
   browser w3m and mobile phones to work, thanks to Helge Tesdal.

 - Don't trigger Localizer instances when traversing if the request
   variable AcceptLanguage does not exist. Thanks to Florent Guillaume.

 - Now LocalPropertyManager.get_default_language returns None if
   there isn't _default_language and get_languages returns an

Localizer is a Zope product that provides a set of facilities
to develop multilingual web applications. It offers solutions to
internationalize the user interfaces and to manage multilingual
content.

This is a bug fix release, the changes are:

 - Open MO files as binary files, this caused problems on Windows.
   Thanks to Johan Carlsson

 - Correctly copy and paste Localizer instances.

 - Correctly detect Netscape 4.x, before Internet Explorer was thought
   to be NS, this caused problems with the language negotiation. Thanks
   to Olivier Nibart.

 - Add the languages from a Localizer instance (if it exists) to the

Localizer 0.9.2
===============

Localizer is a Zope product that provides a set of facilities
to develop multilingual web applications. It offers solutions to
internationalize the user interfaces and to manage multilingual
content.

This is a bug fix release, the changes are:

 - The "zgettext.py" script correctly parses Python files, to do
   it the xgettext program from the GNU Gettext utilities is used.

 - Now "zgettext.py" don't preserves the old messages in the
   locale.pot file.

 - Updated the Unicode patch, by Florent Guillaume.

 - In some rare conditions the request object dissapears from the
   global dictionary, this produces a key error when it's tried to be
   removed. Fixed catching the exception (I couldn't reproduce the
   error).

And a new "feature":

 - Added the new module "LocalizerSupport.py", it helps to develop
   Localizer based products that become monolingual when Localizer
   is not installed (instead of becoming broken). It provides dummy
   versions for some of the features of Localizer, not all.

Localizer becomes beta
----------------------

Finally I've decided to officially declare Localizer as beta. This
means that no new features will be added for the 1.0 release, the
focus will be stability and documentation.


What's new
----------

Added unicode support to ZPT. Final version by Florent Guillaume.

New icons for all the meta types. Now Localizer has a logo (see logo.gif).
This is a contribution of Maite Rementeria, from Code&Syntax [2].

Spanish translation updated. New japanese version!, by Kazuya Fukamachi.

Some minor bugs fixed.

Footnotes
---------

Localizer 0.9.0
===============

General arquitecture

  In the version 0.9 there're four meta types (Localizer, MessageCatalog,
  LocalContent and LocalFolder), each one specialized in one task, finishing
  this way with the confusion present in previous versions, where the
  different features weren't clearly separated.

  Previous versions mixed two features in the Localizer meta type, language
  negotiation and generic support of multilingual objects.

  Now the Localizer meta type is specialized in language negotiation. And a
  new meta type, named LocalFolder, provides the generic support for language
  negotiation following a different approach.

  The old "locale folders" feature that was present in the Localizer meta
  type has been definitely removed.


Language negotiation

  This is one of the areas that has seen mayor improvements since version
  0.8, now there's a simple default criteria to choose the language, based
  only in the browser configuration. But the developer has much more power
  to customize the language negotiation policy through the Localizer meta
  type.

  Also, the algorithm that chooses the language is finally standards compliant.


Unicode

  The Unicode support is another of the big new features in this version.
  To implement it now Localizer depends on the Unicode patches from Toby
  Dickenson (http://www.zope.org/Members/htrd/wstring), which are part of
  Zope since the version 2.6.

  Now the policy is to use Python Unicode strings for everything:

   - translations in the message catalog are stored as unicode strings;

   - multilingual properties of LocalContent objects are stored as unicode
     strings;

   - the gettext method, when used from the file system, always returns
     unicode strings (as the "ugettext" method of the "gettext" python
     module).

  The problem could raise when unicode and normal strings are mixed. By
  default Python converts the normal strings to unicode as if they were
  in ASCII. However, in Zope the default is considered to be iso-8859-1,
  which is hardcoded in several places. Just be careful if you mix normal
  and unicode strings, specially if they're in an encoding different than
  iso-8859-1.

  But maybe the main problem is the lack of proper unicode support in ZPT,
  this will cause problems to anybody that wants to use ZPT and Unicode.

  So it's likely that both Zope and Localizer will need a bit of work before
  the Unicode support becomes stable.


Message Catalog

  The message catalog interface has been completely redone. Now it correctly
  supports multiline messages, including correct import and export from and
  to PO files (thanks to Jean-Paul Smets).


There're other minor changes, like some improvements in the management
screens. The relevant links are:
