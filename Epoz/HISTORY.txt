Epoz - History

 0.7.5

     - updated to Plone 2.0 format in preparation of the release (limi).

     - added portugese-translation; Thanks to Nuno Teixeira!!!

     - added chinese-translation; Thanks to panjunyong!!!

 0.7.4

     - fixed bug: Catched all errors for XMLRPC-call, so
       content is secured if something fails between
       client and server.

     - Changed char_encoding for mxTidy from raw to utf8
       to avoid problems with &nbsp;

 0.7.3

     - changed all default-encodings to utf-8; sorry,
       I've had a broken installation of mxTidy so I thought
       utf-8 didn't work well with mxTidy and released 0.7.2
       to early... removed charset-arg from EpozTidy.

 0.7.2

     - changed toolbox-icon into a folder; link-icon and
       toolbox-icon were to similar before.

     - added remove-format-button; this can be useful if you want
       to remove several text-formats at once. Maybe someone can
       provide a better icon? Please note: IE is a little bit
       smarter than Mozilla. IE removes colors as well...

     - made some css-fixes for using Epoz with tableless layout
       in Plone 2:

        - removed nowrap-style around epoz_toolbox;

        - changed toolbox-width in wysiwyg_support from
          absolute px to relative percentage, so Epoz won't
          break the layout anymore;

        - made widget xhtml-compatible.

       Please note: Epoz uses the Plone-CSS to render the content.
       The Plone-CSS doesn't allow other alignments then left-aligned
       for paragraphs and so clicking on the Epoz-alignment-buttons
       shows no effect in Plone. Please don't mail me about this...
       fix the Plone-CSS (remove 'text-align: left;' from
       p-defintion in plone.css).

     - removed break_before_br in EpozTidy to keep pre-formatted
       text in order.

     - fixed bug: Stefanie Panke noticed encoding problems
       when using the Euro-Sign. Switched all default
       encodings from ISO-8859-1 to more universal windows-1252.
       Thanks, Stefanie!

     - fixed bug: Casey Duncan from Zope Corporation tracked
       down a subtle bug in the product initialisation process
       of Epoz. Short story: Registering a product and a method
       with the same name (Epoz) can cause conflicts under some
       circumstances (esp. running test-suites in Zope 2.7 etc.).
       Now Epoz is marked as __replaceable__. Thanks, Casey!!!

     - fixed bug: removed hardcoded protocol (http:) in
       XMLRPC-call; Epoz over https: should now work again.
       Thanks to Gabriel Wicke for his complaints!

 0.7.1

     - fixed critical bug: Mozilla truncated contents to
       4096 bytes received from EpozTidy over XMLRPC
       due to a bug in the string-code of the vcXMLRPC-library.

     - fixed critical bug: if mxTidy found errors in html,
       an empty document was returned to Epoz. JavaScript-alert
       informs the user about critical errors in document.

     - added a paragraph in the README.txt explaining the
       relation of Epoz 0.x to Epoz 1.x. Thanks to
       Gregor Hoffleit!

     - updated french tranlsation; Thanks to Jean Laroque!!!

 0.7.0

     - added support for mxTidy to produce nice and valid xhtml-code.

     - added site-hook EpozPostTidy, so you can change the output of Epoz
       with an additional script / external method. Useful if you want
       to clean up or rewrite (absolute) links etc.pp.

     - added missing language support for Plone.

     - fixed breadcrumb-bug in Plone-Toolbox.

     - updated sample code for edit-method; now a File-Object is used
       as default, because, no, really no, Epoz can't edit any DTML-tags...

     - updated hungarian translation. thanks to Tamas Decsi.

 0.6.1

     - Fixed bug: The css-skin-parameter in wysiwyg_support.pt wasn't
       url quoted, so skin-names with spaces weren't called correctly.

 0.6.0

     - Epoz renders now the wysiwyg-textarea with your given
       css-styles. This gives you a more realistic feeling about
       the look of your work (esp. in Plone). Many kudos to
       Ariel Sebbag for the solution to a real problem!!!

     - Fixed issue for from time to time disabled wysiwyg-areas on
       Mozilla. Removed EpozTimeOut by a try-catch-poll in order
       to get Mozilla working in wysiwyg-mode. Many thanks to
       Guido Wesdorp for this idea!!!

     - Improved Table-Popup: Now you can insert tables
       with or without heads.

     - Added nowrap-style around Epoz-Toolbar so buttons
       won't break onto two lines.

     - Added finish translation. Thanks to Petri Savolainen!


 0.5.2

     - Added strikethrough-button. Now you can use Epoz to correct
       websites online if you are a teacher...;)

     - Added nice workaround for all people who want cleaner
       html-code from Epoz: switching the views (wysiwyg, source)
       automatically before submitting the form will give you
       browser-cleaned-up-code (Mozilla does a nice job, IE is crap
       anyway).

     - Added hungarian-translation. Thanks to Tamas Decsi and
       Gabor Suveg!

     - Fixed bug in epoz_toolbox. The default_charset was broken.
       Thanks to Marian Saeger for the patch!

     - Fixed a minor bug in the Plone-Toolbox: Images with single
       quotes in the title weren't opened in the popup. Thanks to
       Tony Addyman.

     - Added a dummy blank page. IE breaks over SSL if no source
       is given in the inline frame. Thanks to Brian Brinegar for
       his patches!

     - Sanitized the Epoz-init-string in __init__.py with dictionary.
       Thanks to Philipp von Weitershausen for his patch!

     - Improved i18n-layer. Untranslated strings will now fall
       back to default-english. Thanks to Sergey Volobuev for his
       help and patches!

     - fixed typo in the example in the README.txt.
       Thanks to Luiz Fernando.


 0.5.1

     - fixed bug with different format-tags for IE
       and Mozilla. Mozilla couldn't "unbold" text which
       was created with IE.

       Mozilla now inserts no more style-tags
       for simple formats like bold and italics. Additionaly
       IE's EM- and STRONG-tags will be converted to Mozilla's
       I- and B-tags, which works perfectly with both browsers
       rich-text-controls.

     - introduced EpozTimeOut; if you encounter problems with
       Mozilla on MacOS / etc.pp. (you can't see a cursor
       in the wysiwyg-area or edit anything) adjust this variable.

     - added norwegian-language-file. Thanks to Einar Naess Jensen!


 0.5.0

     - added source-view-switch. Now you can view / edit
       the html-source by clicking on the little checkbox
       below the editor. If you use a customized
       widget-template, please diff it to the current one
       before upgrading.

     - added search-feature to Plone-Toolbox. Now you can
       search for contents via SearchableText.

     - added a frameborder="0" to iframe, so IE doesn't
       render an additional border anymore.

     - added French translation; Thanks to Jean Laroque &
       Yannick Dirou!

     - switched license to Zope Public License (ZPL 2.0).
       This should give you more freedom in integrating
       Epoz into your own commercial applications / services.


 0.4.1

     - fixed bug in wysiwyg_support.pt for Plone 1.0.1. No more dependency
       on global 'member' which was introduced after 1.0.1.

     - added missing translations for Spanish. Thanks to Pedro J. Rey Sanchiz!

     - added Polnish translation; Thanks to Jakub Kasprzycki!

     - added Dutch translation; Thanks to Ad Schellevis!


 0.4.0

     - redesigned buttons with CSS; now you can have a real
       customizable Plone/or/something/else-look&feel...:)
       Please note: I had to make some minor changes to the Epoz-API,
       so diff your customized templates against the current
       ones before upgrading.
       Thanks to Vidar Andersen from BlackTar.com for providing the
       icons! I had to convert Vidar's icons to GIFs, because IE
       doesn't handle PNGs with transparent background
       very well.

     - fixed bug in wysiwyg_support: no more error when wysiwyg
       is not set.

     - added language-file for italian; thanks to Nicola Bertellini

     - added language-file for russian; thanks to Sergey V. Volobuev!

     - added missing translations to pt-BR;
       thanks to Luiz Fernando Pasqual S. Souza!


 0.3.0

     - added a default-toolbox for Plone. Now you can insert links & images
       by simply navigating through your site... could be a killer-feature
       for Epoz & Plone.

     - fixed installer: Epoz will not be added more than once to the
       available editor-list in Plone.

     - minor fix: corrected alt-attributes for sub/superscript-button.


 0.2.3

     - fixed bug: backslashes weren't quoted, so Epoz did eat them
       up. Thanks to Michael Bickel. (Note: Please update your
       PythonScript if you use Epoz on a shared server like
       freezope.org.)

     - fixed bug: Epoz didn't work when Zope was served via CGI, corrected
       the path to Epoz-scripts with BASE1. Thanks to Ralf Kraudelt.

     - minor clean/speed-up for select-format. Thanks to Puna Tannehill.


 0.2.2

     - added buttons for sub- and superscript to Epoz.

     - added a widget-parameter, so you can specify your own-js-widget
       for Epoz; take epoz_script_widget.js as starting-point.

     - changed timeout from 10 to 100 for Mozilla getting the midas-controls.
       This should fix some sync-issues with Mozilla.

     - made widget-rendering faster by removing expensive document.writeln
       for each row; added a break after tag-selection-box, so
       Epoz won't need so much horizontal space.

     - added translation for background-color to pt-br.
       Thanks to Luiz Fernando.


 0.2.1

     - Tables are now inserted at the current selection.

     - added a focus-on-load for table- and colorselector, so an
       already openend tool is brought into front when already opened.
       Thanks to Puna Tannehill.

     - reworked code; the Epoz-Editor is only fetched once by getElementbyId,
       so this should speed up Epoz on slow machines; Thanks to Puna Tannehill.

     - removed focus (and bottom-scrolling on IE) for initialization
       of document; Thanks to Puna Tannehill.

     - fixed bug: IE on MacOS was recognized as rich-text-editor,
       which it is not; Bill G., maybe you can sync your IE's on
       all platforms? Thanks to Martin Huntley.

     - fixed bug: Gecko-Browsers without Midas will now display a
       textarea instead of breaking.

     - corrected language-code for Portuguese/Brasil (pt-br).


 0.2

     - integrated Epoz as Wysiwyg-Editor into Plone.
       Added install-script for Plone. Moved files to skin/epoz and prefixed
       them with 'epoz_*'.

     - seperated JavaScripts for browser-detection, widget-drawing, etc.

     - removed hard-wired-dependency on SubmitEpoz for submit-buttons. You
       can/must use your own submit-button now! Please correct your forms
       (simply add a submit-button).  Removed submit from parameter-list.

     - removed useless table around Epoz-Box.


 0.1.2

     - reworked table-selection as popup-window.

     - reworked color-selector as popup-window. The former
       iframe-implementation was broken in Plone.

     - added a background-color-selection.

     - cleaned up the JavaScript-code a bit.

     - added a portugese(brasilian)-language-file. Thanks to Luiz
       Fernando Pasqual S. Souza!

     - added spanish-language-file. Thanks to Pedro J. Rey Sanchiz!

     - html-quoted non-ascii-chars in language-files.
       InternetExplorer can crash when Unicode is set as character
       set, but latin-coded "umlaute" appear in JavaScript.

     - made the submit-button optional (pass a empty
       submit-paramter). This will make it easier to integrate Epoz
       into your own form-layout. Please be sure to call
       onclick="SubmitEpoz();" for your customized submitt-button.
       Thanks to Volker Bachschneider!


 0.1.1

     - removed dependency on hard-wired paths to scripts/images; Epoz can now
       be used more easily standalone

     - added a description on how to turn Epoz into a
       standalone-Zope-Web-Application which can be installed on shared
       servers with no filesystem access (e.g. freezope.org)

     - added newlines to CreateTable (results in more readable table-source)

     - added a convenient catch for calling Epoz when data is None;
       thanks to Joachim Schmitz!

     - fixed broken style-parameter

     - fixed a spelling-typo in www/de.js

     - fixed some minor misunderstandings in the README.txt; corrected
       sample-edit-method (no more empty action, method should be post)


 0.1

     - inital release
